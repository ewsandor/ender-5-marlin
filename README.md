# Ender-5-Marlin
Custom configuration.h and configuration_adv.h for Ender 5 with Marlin 2.  This config is specifc to Ed Sandor's Ender 5 which has been modified with a BLTouch and silent mother board; it is likely not compatible with your Ender 5 as is.

This config is based on firestrife23's Marlin 1 config and the example Ender 5 config released with Marlin 2.0.5.3.  The configuration has been updated specifically to my machine's non-stock hardware and callibration.
